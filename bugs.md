# List of Bugs

## Gameplay Bugs

### Major Bugs

- Scarletwoman
  - Disregard all else that is said about Scarletwoman
  - She works, but needs to be used through a day ability
  - That is, she won't trigger automatically, but you can still put her in the game if you need her
- Scarletwoman
  - Add event listeners?
  - Store functions that change the state in reaction to a certain type of event (in the log?, maybe the state)
  - Run these functions when a specific event is logged (have a log event function that is overwritten)
- Virgin and slayer will keep their abilities if they are poisoned when they use them
  - This is because poison only affects setup and night(one) abilities
- Sometimes button has to be pressed twice to skip through setup
